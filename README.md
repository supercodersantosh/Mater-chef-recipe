Mutton Biryani Recipe
INSTRUCTIONS
Soak the rice for half an hour before you start cooking.
In a pressure cooker, add the meat along with all the dry, powdered spices and cook it in 1 1/2 cups of water on medium flame for about 20 minutes. Remove it from heat after approximately 15 whistles.
Add cinnamon, cloves and cardamom to hot oil in another pressure cooker. Sauté the onions before adding tomatoes, ginger garlic paste, curd and green chillies. Continue sautéing till oil starts to separate from the mix.
Now add the basmati rice after completely draining it. To this, add the meat along with the gravy, and add some more water.
Close the lid and pressure cook on high flame until the first whistle and then on low flame for about 3-4 minutes.
Turn off the heat and let the pressure release naturally. The heat inside will slowly bring out more flavours without overcooking it.
Garnish with some coriander and squeeze a few drops of lemon on top. Serve hot along with onion raitha and salan.
